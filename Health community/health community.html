    <h3>Nuclear Medicine: What is it?</h3>
    <p><span class="highlight">Nuclear medicine</span> is a type of medical imaging that uses small amounts of radioactive material to diagnose or treat diseases. It allows doctors to see how organs and tissues are functioning in real time. This can detect abnormalities much earlier than traditional scans like X-rays or CTs, which often only show structural problems.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>Nuclear medicine works by using small amounts of radioactive substances called <strong>radiopharmaceuticals</strong>. These can be injected, swallowed, or inhaled. Once inside the body, the substance travels to the targeted organ or tissue and emits gamma rays, which are detected by a camera called a gamma scanner or PET scanner. This creates detailed images that show how the organ is working.</p>

    <h3>What are common uses?</h3>
    <p>Nuclear medicine is commonly used for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detecting cancer and monitoring how it responds to treatment</li>
      <li>Evaluating heart disease, such as blood flow and damage after a heart attack</li>
      <li>Examining thyroid, kidney, and bone function</li>
      <li>Locating infections and bleeding internally</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Is it safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, nuclear medicine is generally very safe. The radioactive doses used are very low and specifically chosen to minimize risk while still giving useful results. The body naturally eliminates most of the radioactive material within hours or days. The benefit of early diagnosis and effective monitoring often outweighs any minimal risk.</p>

    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
    <p>Nuclear medicine isn't just diagnostic—it can also be therapeutic. For example, radioactive iodine is used to treat hyperthyroidism and certain thyroid cancers, directly targeting diseased tissue without invasive surgery.</p>
